            We are so excited you chose to celebrate your 6 year Anniversary
            with me. I can't believe time has flown by! 6 years ago I was
            blindsided while I was about to go on a run and told you I lived at
            High Park station when in fact I lived at my parents in Etobicoke!
            Now look at us... we've been to Poland, Halifax, Ireland, England,
            France, Denver, Montreal, Ottawa and who can forget the summers at
            the cottage?!? As a token of my appreciation I would love for you to
            select a gift as a sign of gratitude for putting up with my
            craziness!
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-rose-600">Love, Kevin</p>
